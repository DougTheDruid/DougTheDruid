## Ahoy ü¶ú
Developerüñ•Ô∏è/Pirateüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è extraordinaire at your service. I have been developing for nearly 10 years, the most recent 4+ of which have been fully dedicated to python. I am constantly seeking new ways to challenge myself and learn something unconventional. A side-project which fell victim to an immeasurable amount of scope-creep eventually led me here; using my development skills to learn, document, build, and share information about video game hacking. While it's not the most traditional of programming areas, I believe I've found a niche my skills satisfy: Well-documented, accessible, python-based game-hacking resources. The goal with any of my projects is to identify something traditionally viewed as "complex", learn it, apply it to python, and share that learning process here in code. 

Nearly every day you can find me working on one of the following projects.

###  I'm currently working on... üõ†Ô∏è‚õµ
My primary work is around [my external python-based game hack](https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-ESP-Framework). This framework provides a starting point for developers looking to understand external video game hacking, primarily through reading memory, using python! This project has been in development constantly over the past three years and under-gone many revisions and changes. The most recent major changes are to the documentation for my projects, providing an even higher level of guidance and explanation for folks just getting started. Part of this work includes upkeeping of my other repos as well, as they all generally relate to one another.

I also am building a python-based script for generating an SDK for Unreal Engine 4 games. My program almost entirely replicates functionality of C++/C# written counterparts, just in a more simplified manner.

### I'm learning about... üñ•Ô∏èüìö
I have an ambition to take my external framework and build an internal counterpart, all in python. In theory this should drastically improve performance and allow for a deeper-level of access into the video game processes. I have not been able to find a single example of a python-based internal hack which provides meaningful c-like functionality, so my progress could be extremely helpful to the open-source community.
