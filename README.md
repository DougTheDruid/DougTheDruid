Developerüñ•Ô∏è/Pirateüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è extrodinare at your service. Nearly every day you can find me working on one of the following projects. See the below for information on how to contact me.

###  I'm currently working on... üõ†Ô∏è
My primary work is around [my external python-based game hack](https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-ESP-Framework). This framework provides a starting point for developers looking to understand external video game hacking, primarily through reading memory, using python! This project has been in development constantly over the past three years and under-gone many revisions and changes. The most recent major changes are to the documentation for my projects, providing an even higher level of guidence and explination to get started.

I also am building a python-based script for generating an SDK for Unreal Engine 4 games. My program almost entirely replicates functionality of C++/C# written counterparts, just in a more simplified manner.

### I'm learning about... üí≠
I have an ambition to take my external framework and build an internal counterpart, all in python. In theory this should drastically improve performance and allow for a deeper-level of access into the video game processes. I have not been able to find a single example of a python-based internal hack which provides meaningful c-like functionality, so my progress could be extremely helpful to the open-source community.
