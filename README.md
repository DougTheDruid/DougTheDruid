Developerüñ•Ô∏è/Pirateüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è extrodinare at your service. Nearly every day you can find me working on one of the following projects. See below for information on how to contact me

###  I'm currently working on... üõ†Ô∏è
My primary work is around [my python-based game hack](https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-ESP-Framework). This framework provides a starting point for developers looking to understand external video game hacking, primarily through reading memory. This project has been in development constantly over the past three years and under-gone many revisions and changes. The most recent major changes are to the documentation for my projects, providing an even higher level of guidence and explination to get started.

I also am building a python-based script for generating an SDK for Unreal Engine 4 games. My program almost entirely replicates functionality of C++/C# written counterparts, just in a more simplified manner. 

### I'm learning about... üí≠
I have an ambition to take my external framework and build an internal-counterpart, all in python. This would allow a deeper-level of access into the video games processes and hopefully provide others even more resource for video game hacking.
